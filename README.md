## Meaning
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It's the foundation of the web, providing the building blocks for headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements that make up a webpage. HTML defines what content is and where it goes on a page, but it doesn't control how that content looks or behaves, according to the Server Side.

## HTML page structure
```bash
./minecraft.exe
